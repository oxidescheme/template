<b>oxide</b> for [TOOL_NAME] brings the oxide colorscheme to [TOOL_DESCRIPTION] with OKLCH precision.
A minimalist dark theme built around clarity and restraint, using a deep near-black background, crisp white foregrounds, and soft pastel accents to emphasize structure without visual noise.
</p>

## Design Philosophy

oxide is built on three core principles:

- **Function first**: If a color does not serve a purpose, it does not belong
- **Visual silence**: High contrast is reserved for data that matters; everything else recedes
- **Calculated colors**: Built with OKLCH color space so all colors have consistent brightness and work well together

The full design philosophy and color system are documented in the [main oxide repository](https://github.com/oxidescheme/oxide).

## Color Palette

oxide uses OKLCH color space for precise, perceptually uniform colors:

- **Background**: Deep void-like `#161616` for optimal readability
- **Foreground**: Crisp `#cecece` text that doesn't strain your eyes
- **Accents**: 9 semantic colors with consistent lightness values
- **[Tool-specific color usage]**: [Description of how colors are used in this specific tool]
